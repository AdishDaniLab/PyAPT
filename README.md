PyAPT
=====
Controlling Thorlabs APT using Python code using APT.dll and APT.lib, bypassing the activex controls.

Installation
==
Obtain APT.dll and APT.lib from Thorlabs directly, or from the APTDLLPack/DLL/ folder, picking the correct version (x86 or x64)
Place APT.dll, APT.lib and PyAPT.py in the folder from which the scripts will be executed, or in the main add-on folder for python.



This is still a rough copy that I am improving as I work on my project. Please report any bugs, and feel free to email me comments or suggestions. Even better: make the changes and push them back to me!
