PyAPT
=====
Controlling Thorlabs APT using Python code using APT.dll and APT.lib, bypassing the activex controls.

**Installation**

Obtain APT.dll and APT.lib from Thorlabs directly, or from the APTDLLPack/DLL/ folder, picking the correct version (x86 or x64)
Place APT.dll, APT.lib and PyAPT.py in the folder from which the scripts will be executed, or in the main add-on folder for python.

**Running the code**

Ensure correct version (32 or 64 bit) APT.dll and APT.lib are in the folder containing the python script.
```example.py``` contains an example of how to load the module, control the motor, and close the object.

This is still a rough copy that I am improving as I work on my project. Please report any bugs, and feel free to email me comments or suggestions. Even better: make the changes and push them back to me!
